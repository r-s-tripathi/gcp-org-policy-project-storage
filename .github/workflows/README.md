## constraints/storage.retentionPolicySeconds
### This list constraint defines the set of durations for retention policies that can be set on Cloud Storage buckets. By default, if no organization policy is specified, a Cloud Storage bucket can have a retention policy of any duration. The list of allowed durations must be specified as a positive integer value greater than zero, representing the retention policy in seconds. Any insert, update, or patch operation on a bucket in the organization resource must have a retention policy duration that matches the constraint. Enforcement of this constraint is not retroactive. When a new organization policy is applied, the retention policy of existing buckets remain unchanged and valid.

## constraints/storage.uniformBucketLevelAccess
### This boolean constraint requires buckets to use uniform bucket-level access where this constraint is set to True. Any new bucket in the Organization resource must have uniform bucket-level access enabled, and no existing buckets in the organization resource can disable uniform bucket-level access. Enforcement of this constraint is not retroactive: existing buckets with uniform bucket-level access disabled continue to have it disabled. The default value for this constraint is False. Uniform bucket-level access disables the evaluation of ACLs assigned to Cloud Storage objects in the bucket. Consequently, only IAM policies grant access to objects in these buckets.
